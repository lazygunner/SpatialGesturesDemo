# SpatialGesturesDemo

## Project Overview

SpatialGesturesDemo is a demonstration project based on the visionOS platform, showcasing the features and usage of the [SpatialGestures](https://github.com/lazygunner/SpatialGestures) open-source library. This project demonstrates intuitive gesture operations in a spatial environment, including dragging, rotating, and scaling 3D objects.

## Features

- **Spatial Gesture Interaction**: Demonstrates dragging, rotating, and scaling virtual 3D objects
- **Real-time Feedback**: Provides detailed gesture debugging information and entity property display
- **Intuitive Interface**: Includes a debug panel with a transparent glass effect
- **Interactive Reset**: One-click restore of object position, rotation, and scale values

## Technical Implementation

- Built with SwiftUI and RealityKit
- Uses the SpatialGestures library to handle spatial gestures
- Real-time display of gesture and transformation data
- Provides detailed property monitoring panel

## Usage

1. Clone or download this project
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Run using the visionOS simulator or an actual device
4. Interact with the 3D robot model using gestures and observe changes in the debug panel

## Dependencies

- visionOS SDK
- [SpatialGestures](https://github.com/lazygunner/SpatialGestures) library
